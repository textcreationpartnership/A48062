            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM <hi>IACK the COBLER,</hi> To any Body.</head>
            <p>ENvy and Malice, two Twins of the old Seducer, never appear'd in any Age ſo viſible as in ours. I ſuppoſe there are very few but his Diſciples will deny, when it ſhall be conſidered how many there are, that Act as if the fulneſs of the Devil dwelt in them Bodily; a ſort of Creatures who value no more the Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, than the deſerting of their Maſter, when their own Intereſt comes to the Stake; and yet in all places theſe Men roar 41, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Good God ſhall we never be rid of Jeſuitical Knaves, Fools and Fanaticks; but that's a Mercy our ſins will not permit; and we muſt ſtill ſee them Reign great in the popular Vogue. What a dainty thing is a Liſt of the once intended Council of State, in ſome mens guſto; and no doubt the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fellow the Tranſcriber hopes one day for a better preferment for his happy hit, than what ſtands in the way to <hi>Paddington;</hi> which ſome are ready to ſay he merits, for having not only broke the Laws of the Land, but of Chriſtianity it ſelf; how maliciouſly (not to ſay fooliſhly) has he foiſted his Paper upon the World, telling a Story at all Adventures, without any Explanation, and ſo he may ſpit a little Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome at an imaginary Enemy, cares not how much he beſpatters one of the greateſt of the Engliſh Hero's as well as others of a lower Sphere; for by his ſcurrilous Pamphlet he has reduc'd them into the Rank of the greateſt Enemies to our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarchy; but I leave him to his pleaſing Ideas of having been an Author, and paſs on to another Gentleman or two with their Letters of Advice to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What an Age is this, when all Men are or would be thought Polititions which I believe theſe Gentlemen have as much reaſon to Triumph in, as their pretended Friendſhips. And one of them would do well to conſider what himſelf tells us, <hi>viz.</hi> That before Government was ſetled in the firſt Ages of the World, that eternal Rule of Juſtice of doing to all men as they would they ſhould do unto them, was an Obligation even to the very Heathens themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for that to the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> who has deſerved ſo well of the Nation, I think it not fit to be ſpoke of, when his Lordſhip's nam'd, it being a meſs of ſuch Tarpolling ſtuff, as ſhews the Author ſail'd with a brisk Gale, when he fetch'd it from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes of Sence. But now to the Judicious <hi>Philo-Patris</hi> with his Expedients. Come Sirs heres your Famoſo <hi>have we not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>been often deluded with the ſubleties and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the buiſy Jeſuits:</hi> True who doubts it, but the ſtings behind for this had been nothing: if he had not joyn'd the Sons of Corah to 'um an excellent way of Late. The Citizens cannot readily agree who ſhall be choſen <hi>Sheriff</hi>'s, ſtrait the Murther of an excellent Prince is brought upon the Stage, a brave man at Parallels (no doubt he has heard of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but you'l ſay, what has the <hi>Cobler</hi> to doe with the <hi>Stagerite</hi> or his Art of Reaſoning, but of that he intends an account when <hi>Philo-Patris</hi> appears to back hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Yes, we have an eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, a Letter to my Lord Major, <hi>&amp;c.

the poor Man is, and yet how unreaſonable, you may judg, when himſelf with ſo ſtrong a Guard, maintained that Poſt; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that preſently after he has to do both with <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> I cannot blame him for being almoſt in a Frenzie at the ſight of ſo many Popes. But well, ſince Righteouſneſs is the Glory of a Nation, let's chooſe them for Magiſtrates, who never committed any Sin; for why ſhould <hi>Lying</hi> have any priviledge above <hi>Oaths?</hi> In doing which, we ſhall ſhew a gallant Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for Truth; and how ready we are to maintain the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of our King and the Reformed Religion; let us render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to <hi>God</hi> the things that are <hi>Gods,</hi> and not ſell our Birth-rights for humour, or a Meſs of Pottage. Praiſed be God we have a good King, and may thoſe that follow after him, endeavour to imitate his kindneſs to ſo famous a place; and may we not I pray God, run into the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs we fear, by preſſing upon ill Mediums, under the pretence of wholſome Councils. Let us hate leſs, and ſhew it by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak or write things which create Heats and Feuds which I dare to ſay, has ſpoil'd ſome, but never made one good Man. Let us conſider the different Circumſtances of men in their Education, and what Sentiments of things that gives, and how that morally it is impoſſible, that either blind or dim ſighted Men ſhould run as readily in the ſame Ring as thoſe whoſe Eyes are in their prime; and never had any miſts before 'um. This is the way in part, that muſt make us if ever, a happy people, and a flouriſhing City. Let's not only in our Talk, but in our Lives, Convince men of the Excellency of our Religion. So prays a true Son of the Church, an humble Subject, and a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Country.</p>
